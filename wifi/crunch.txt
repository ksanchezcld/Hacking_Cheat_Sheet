- crunch <min> max<max> <characterset> -t <pattern> -o <output filename>

    min = The minimum password length.
    max = The maximum password length.
    characterset = The character set to be used in generating the passwords.
    -t <pattern> = The specified pattern of the generated passwords. For instance, if you knew that the target's birthday was 0728 (July 28th) and you suspected they used their birthday in their password (people often do), you could generate a password list that ended with 0728 by giving crunch the pattern @@@@@@@0728. This word generate passwords up to 11 characters (7 variable and 4 fixed) long that all ended with 0728.
    -o <outputfile> = This is the file you want your wordlist written to.

What if we knew that the target always used number passwords between 6 and 8 characters? We could generate a complete list of password possibilities meeting this criteria and send them to a file in the root user's directory called numericwordlist.lst by typing:

- crunch 6 8 1234567890 -o /root/numericwordlist.lst
- crunch 4 8 :: passwords between 4 and 8 characters.
- crunch 6 8 1234567890 -o /root/numericwordlist.lst
- crunch 10 10 -t @@@@@@0728 -o /root/birthdaywordlist.lst
- crunch 8 8 -f /usr/share/rainbowcrack/charset.txt mixalpha -o /root/alphawordlist.lst

       crunch - generate wordlists from a character set

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       crunch <min-len> <max-len> [<charset string>] [options]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Crunch can create a wordlist based on criteria you specify.  The outout
       from crunch can be sent to the screen, file,  or  to  another  program.
       The required parameters are:

       min-len
              The  minimum  length  string  you want crunch to start at.  This
              option is required even for parameters that won't use the value.

       max-len
              The  maximum  length  string  you  want  crunch to end at.  This
              option is required even for parameters that won't use the value.

       charset string
              You  may specify character sets for crunch to use on the command
              line or if you leave it blank crunch will use the default  char-
              acter sets.  The order MUST BE lower case characters, upper case
              characters, numbers, and then symbols.  If you don't follow this
              order  you  will not get the results you want.  You MUST specify
              either values for the character type or a plus sign.   NOTE:  If
              you  want  to  include the space character in your character set
              you must escape it using the \ character or enclose your charac-
              ter  set in quotes i.e. "abc ".  See the examples 3, 11, 12, and
              13 for examples.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -b number[type]
              Specifies the size of the output file, only works if -o START is
              used,  i.e.:  60MB   The  output  files will be in the format of
              starting letter-ending letter for example: ./crunch 4 5 -b 20mib
              -o START will generate 4 files: aaaa-gvfed.txt, gvfee-ombqy.txt,
              ombqz-wcydt.txt, wcydu-zzzzz.txt valid values for type  are  kb,
              mb,  gb,  kib, mib, and gib.  The first three types are based on
              1000 while the last three types are based on 1024.   NOTE  There
              is  no  space between the number and type.  For example 500mb is
              correct 500 mb is NOT correct.

       -c number
              Specifies the number of lines to  write  to  output  file,  only
              works if -o START is used, i.e.: 60  The output files will be in
              the  format  of  starting  letter-ending  letter  for   example:
              ./crunch  1  1 -f /pentest/password/crunch/charset.lst mixalpha-
              numeric-all-space -o START -c 60 will result in 2 files: a-7.txt
              and  8-\  .txt  The reason for the slash in  the second filename
              is the ending character is space and ls  has  to  escape  it  to
              print it.  Yes you will need to put in the \ when specifying the
              filename because the last character is a space.

       -d numbersymbol
              Limits the number of duplicate characters.   -d  2@  limits  the
              lower  case  alphabet to output like aab and aac.  aaa would not
              be generated as that is 3 consecutive letters of a.  The  format
              is number then symbol where number is the maximum number of con-
              secutive characters and symbol is the symbol of the the  charac-
              ter set you want to limit i.e. @,%^   See examples 17-19.

       -e string
              Specifies when crunch should stop early

       -f /path/to/charset.lst charset-name
              Specifies a character set from the charset.lst

       -i  Inverts  the  output  so  instead  of  aaa,aab,aac,aad, etc you get
              aaa,baa,caa,daa,aba,bba, etc

       -l When you use the -t option this option tells  crunch  which  symbols
              should  be  treated as literals.  This will allow you to use the
              placeholders as letters in the pattern.  The -l option should be
              the same length as the -t option.  See example 15.

       -m Merged with -p.  Please use -p instead.

       -o wordlist.txt
              Specifies the file to write the output to, eg: wordlist.txt

       -p charset OR -p word1 word2 ...
              Tells crunch to generate words that don't have repeating charac-
              ters.  By default  crunch  will  generate  a  wordlist  size  of
              #of_chars_in_charset  ^  max_length.   This  option will instead
              generate #of_chars_in_charset!.  The  !  stands  for  factorial.
              For example say the charset is abc and max length is 4..  Crunch
              will by default generate 3^4  =  81  words.   This  option  will
              instead  generate 3! = 3x2x1 = 6 words (abc, acb, bac, bca, cab,
              cba).  THIS MUST BE THE LAST OPTION!  This option CANNOT be used
              with -s and it ignores min and max length however you must still
              specify two numbers.

       -q filename.txt
              Tells crunch to read filename.txt  and  permute  what  is  read.
              This  is  like the -p option except it gets the input from file-
              name.txt.

       -r Tells crunch to resume generate words from where it  left  off.   -r
              only  works if you use -o.  You must use the same command as the
              original command used to generate the words.  The only exception
              to  this is the -s option.  If your original command used the -s
              option you MUST remove it before you resume the  session.   Just
              add -r to the end of the original command.

       -s startblock
              Specifies a starting string, eg: 03god22fs

       -t @,%^
              Specifies  a pattern, eg: @@god@@@@ where the only the @'s, ,'s,
              %'s, and ^'s will change.
              @ will insert lower case characters
              , will insert upper case characters
              % will insert numbers
              ^ will insert symbols

       -u
              The -u option disables the printpercentage thread.  This  should
              be the last option.

       -z gzip, bzip2, lzma, and 7z
              Compresses  the output from the -o option.  Valid parameters are
              gzip, bzip2, lzma, and 7z.
              gzip is the fastest but the compression is minimal.  bzip2 is  a
              little slower than gzip but has better compression.  7z is slow-
              est but has the best compression.


EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Example 1
       crunch 1 8
       crunch will display a wordlist that starts at a and ends at zzzzzzzz

       Example 2
       crunch 1 6 abcdefg
       crunch will display a wordlist using the  character  set  abcdefg  that
       starts at a and ends at gggggg

       Example 3
       crunch 1 6 abcdefg\
       there  is  a  space  at  the end of the character string.  In order for
       crunch to use the space you will need to escape it using the \  charac-
       ter.   In this example you could also put quotes around the letters and
       not need the \, i.e. "abcdefg ".  Crunch will display a wordlist  using
       the character set abcdefg  that starts at a and ends at (6 spaces)

       Example 4
       crunch 1 8 -f charset.lst mixalpha-numeric-all-space -o wordlist.txt
       crunch  will  use  the  mixalpha-numeric-all-space  character  set from
       charset.lst and will write the wordlist to a file  named  wordlist.txt.
       The file will start with a and end with "        "

       Example 5
       crunch 8 8 -f charset.lst mixalpha-numeric-all-space -o wordlist.txt -t
       @@dog@@@ -s cbdogaaa
       crunch should generate a 8 character wordlist using  the  mixalpha-num-
       ber-all-space  character  set  from  charset.lst  and  will  write  the
       wordlist to a file named wordlist.txt.  The file will start at cbdogaaa
       and end at "  dog   "

       Example 6
       crunch 2 3 -f charset.lst ualpha -s BB
       crunch  with  start generating a wordlist at BB and end with ZZZ.  This
       is useful if you have to stop generating  a  wordlist  in  the  middle.
       Just  do  a tail wordlist.txt and set the -s parameter to the next word
       in the sequence.  Be sure to rename the original  wordlist  BEFORE  you
       begin as crunch will overwrite the existing wordlist.

       Example 7
       crunch 4 5 -p abc
       The numbers aren't processed but are needed.
       crunch will generate abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba.

       Example 8
       crunch 4 5 -p dog cat bird
       The numbers aren't processed but are needed.
       crunch  will  generate  birdcatdog, birddogcat, catbirddog, catdogbird,
       dogbirdcat, dogcatbird.

       Example 9
       crunch 1 5 -o START -c 6000 -z bzip2
       crunch will generate bzip2 compressed files with each  file  containing
       6000  words.  The filenames of the compressed files will be first_word-
       last_word.txt.bz2

       # time ./crunch 1 4 -o START -c 6000 -z gzip
       real    0m2.729s
       user    0m2.216s

       sys     0m32.634s

       size  filename

       3.8K  aaaa-aiwt.txt.bz2
       1.1K  aaaa-aiwt.txt.lzma

       Example 10
       crunch 4 5 -b 20mib -o START
       will  generate  4  files:   aaaa-gvfed.txt,   gvfee-ombqy.txt,   ombqz-
       wcydt.txt, wcydu-zzzzz.txt
       the  first  three  files  are 20MBs (real power of 2 MegaBytes) and the
       last file is 11MB.

       Example 11
       crunch 3 3 abc + 123 !@# -t @%^
       will generate a 3 character long word with a  character  as  the  first
       character,  and  number  as  the second character, and a symbol for the
       third character.  The order in which you  specify  the  characters  you
       want is important.  You must specify the order as lower case character,
       upper case character, number, and symbol.  If you aren't going to use a
       particular  character set you use a plus sign as a placeholder.  As you
       can see I am not using the upper case character set so I am  using  the
       plus sign placeholder.  The above will start at a1! and end at c3#

       Example 12
       crunch 3 3 abc + 123 !@# -t ^%@
       will generate 3 character words starting with !1a and ending with #3c

       Example 13
       crunch 4 4  + + 123 + -t %%@^
       the  plus sign (+) is a place holder so you can specify a character set
       for the character type.  crunch will use the default character set  for
       the  character  type when crunch encounters a + (plus sign) on the com-
       mand line.  You must either specify values for each character  type  or
       use  the  plus  sign.   I.E.  if you have two characters types you MUST
       either specify values for each type or use a plus  sign.   So  in  this
       example the character sets will be:
       abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
       123
       !@#$%^&*()-_+=~`[]{}|\:;"'<>,.?/
       there is a space at the end of the above string
       the  output  will start at 11a! and end at "33z ".  The quotes show the
       space at the end of the string.

       Example 14
       crunch 5 5 -t ddd@@ -o j -p dog cat bird
       any character other than one of the following: @,%^
       is the placeholder for the words to permute.  The @,%^ symbols have the
       same function as -t.
       If  you  want  to  use @,%^ in your output you can use the -l option to
       specify which character you want crunch to treat as a literal.
       So the results are
       birdcatdogaa
       birdcatdogab
       birdcatdogac
       <skipped>
       dogcatbirdzy
       dogcatbirdzz

       Example 15
       crunch 7 7 -t p@ss,%^ -l a@aaaaa
       crunch will now treat the @ symbol  as  a  literal  character  and  not
       replace the character with a uppercase letter.
       this will generate
       p@ssA0!
       p@ssA0@
       p@ssA0#
       p@ssA0$
       <skipped>
       p@ssZ9

       Example 16
       crunch 5 5 -s @4#S2 -t @%^,2 -e @8 Q2 -l @dddd -b 10KB -o START
       crunch will generate 5 character strings starting with @4#S2 and ending
       at @8 Q2.  The output will be broken into 10KB sized  files  named  for
       the files starting and ending strings.

       Example 17
       crunch 5 5 -d 2@ -t @@@%%
       crunch  will generate 5 character strings staring with aab00 and ending
       at zzy99.  Notice that aaa and zzz are not present.

       Example 18
       crunch 10 10 -t @@@^%%%%^^ -d 2@ -d 3% -b 20mb -o START
       crunch will generate 10 character strings starting with aab!0001!!  and
       ending at zzy 9998    The output will be written to 20mb files.

       Example 19
       crunch 8 8 -d 2@
       crunch  will gernerate 8 characters that limit the same number of lower
       case characters to 2.   Crunch  will  start  at  aabaabaa  and  end  at
       zzyzzyzz.

       Example 20
       crunch 4 4 -f unicode_test.lst japanese -t @@%% -l @xdd
       crunch will load some japanese characters from the unicode_test charac-
       ter set file.  The output will start at @ae=Y00 and end at @`e_a99.

RREEDDIIRREECCTTIIOONN
       You can use crunch's output and pipe it into other programs.   The  two
       most popular programs to pipe crunch into are: aircrack-ng and airolib-
       ng.  The syntax is as follows:
       crunch 2 4 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz | aircrack-ng /root/Mycapfile.cap
       -e MyESSID -w-
       crunch 10 10 12345 --stdout | airolib-ng testdb -import passwd -

NNOOTTEESS
       1.  Starting  in version 2.6 crunch will display how much data is about
       to be generated.  In 2.7 it will also display how many  lines  will  be
       generated.   Crunch will now wait 3 seconds BEFORE it begins generating
       data to give you time to press Ctrl-C to abort crunch if you  find  the
       values are too large for your application.

       2.   I   have   added   hex-lower   (0123456789abcdef)   and  hex-upper
       (0123456789ABCDEF) to charset.lst.

       3. Several people have requested that I add support for the space char-
       acter  to  crunch.   crunch has always supported the space character on
       the command line and in the charset.lst.  To add a space on the command
       line  you  must escape it using the / character.  See example 3 for the
       syntax.  You may need to escape other characters like ! or #  depending
       on your operating system.

       4.  Starting  in 2.7 if you are generating a file then every 10 seconds
       you will receive the % done.

       5. Starting in 3.0 I had to change the -t * character to a , as  the  *
       is  a  reserved  character.   You  could still use it if you put a \ in
       front of the *.  Yes it breaks crunch's syntax and  I  do  my  best  to
       avoid  doing that, but in this instance it is easier to make the change
       for long term support.

       6. Some output is missing.  A file didn't get generated.
       The mostly explaination is you ran out of disk space.  If you have ver-
       ified you have plenty of disk space then the problem is most likely the
       filename begins with a period.  In Linux filenames that  begin  with  a
       period are hidden.  To view them do a ls -l .*

       7.  Crunch  says The maximum and minimum length should be the same size
       as the pattern you specified, however the length is set correctly.
       This usually means your pattern contains a character that needs  to  be
       escaped.  In bash you need to escape the followings: &, *, space, \, (,
       ), |, ', ", ;, <, >.
       The escape character in bash is a \.  So a pattern that has a & and a *
       in it would look like this:
       crunch 4 4 -t \&\*d@
       An  alternative  to  escaping  characters  is  to wrap your string with
       quotes.  For example:
       crunch 4 4 -t "&*d@"
       If you want to use the " in your pattern you will  need  to  escape  it
       like this: crunch 4 4 -t "&*\"@"
       Please  note  that different terminals have different escape characters
       and probably have different characters that will need escaping.  Please
       check  the manpage of your terminal for the escape characters and char-
       acters that need escaping.

       8. When using the -z 7z option, 7z does not delete the  original  file.
       You will have to delete those files by hand.
